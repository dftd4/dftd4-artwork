## The D4 circle

To provide a short graphical overview over the capabilities of D4, this circle was created.

Additional focus on the different fields of the circle

<img src="./full-circle/d4-focus-main.svg" alt="D4 focus main-group" width="200"> <img src="./full-circle/d4-focus-organometallics.svg" alt="D4 focus organometallics" width="200"> <img src="./full-circle/d4-focus-solids.svg" alt="D4 focus solids" width="200"> <img src="./full-circle/d4-focus-surfaces.svg" alt="D4 focus surfaces" width="200">

There seems to be a happy coincidence with the eigth album of the band
Five Finger Death Punch, both in the naming and general style of the graphic.
Therefore, we use the opportunity to include a reference to their
[album F8](https://5fdp.ffm.to/f8album) here :metal:.
